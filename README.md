# 🌐 Next.js VPS Deployment Guide (Without Docker)

This repository provides a comprehensive step-by-step guide to deploying a **Next.js** application on a **Linux-based VPS** using:

- Custom domain (e.g. `app.yourdomain.com`)
- Specific port (e.g. `4300`)
- Free SSL with Let's Encrypt
- NGINX reverse proxy
- Cloudflare DNS integration
- Swap setup for low-memory VPS
- Monitoring for uptime, SSL, and domain expiry

> 🛠️ This deployment **does not use Docker**, making it lightweight and straightforward for developers who prefer native Linux environments.

## 📌 Why Without Docker?

While Docker offers portability and consistency, not every environment or team requires it — especially for small VPS deployments or low-resource servers. In some cases, such as deployments for small businesses (UMKM) in Indonesia, teams may prefer to avoid Docker due to budget constraints and limited server resources.

## ✅ Advantages of Not Using Docker

- **Less overhead**: No need to run containers or manage Docker daemon.
- **Lower memory usage**: Ideal for low-RAM VPS (512MB–2GB).
- **Faster setup**: Simpler for beginners or one-off projects.
- **Direct access to logs and processes** via PM2 and Linux tools.

---

## ⚠️ Disadvantages of Not Using Docker

- **Less portability**: Harder to migrate across servers or replicate environments.
- **Manual environment management**: You must install Node.js, NGINX, etc., yourself.
- **Dependency conflicts**: No container isolation means your server environment can become messy over time.
- **No image versioning**: You can't easily roll back to previous builds like Docker images.
